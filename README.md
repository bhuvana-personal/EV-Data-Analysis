 ##**Introduction**
 
 This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle Population dataset published by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset contains detailed records of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered across Washington State. It includes information such as vehicle make and model, model year, electric range, base MSRP, CAFV eligibility, and geographic details like county, city, and vehicle location. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of electric vehicle adoption, pricing trends, performance characteristics, and regional distribution.

The objectives of this analysis are to:

Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, zero values, and duplicate records.

Explore trends in electric vehicle adoption across model years, manufacturers, and counties.

Analyze the relationship between electric range and vehicle pricing (Base MSRP).

Visualize key insights using charts and graphs for better interpretation.

Build a linear regression model to predict the electric range of a vehicle based on selected features.

Derive insights that can support decision-making related to electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure planning.

##**conclusion**

This analysis of the Electric Vehicle Population dataset provides valuable insights into electric vehicle adoption patterns in Washington State. The results show a strong and consistent growth in electric vehicle registrations over recent model years, indicating increasing consumer acceptance and supportive policy measures. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) significantly outnumber Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), highlighting a clear shift toward fully electric transportation.

The analysis reveals that electric vehicle adoption is highly concentrated in urban regions, with King County accounting for the largest share of registrations. Tesla emerges as the dominant manufacturer, followed by brands such as Chevrolet, Nissan, and Ford. Vehicles with higher base MSRP generally exhibit greater electric range, reflecting the impact of advanced battery technology and vehicle design.

Data cleaning played a critical role in improving data quality, particularly through the handling of missing and zero values in the Base MSRP and Electric Range columns. The linear regression model demonstrated that variables such as model year and base MSRP have a positive influence on electric range, achieving reasonable predictive performance. Overall, this study highlights key trends in electric vehicle adoption, pricing, and performance, and provides insights that can support policy planning, infrastructure development, and future research in sustainable transportation
