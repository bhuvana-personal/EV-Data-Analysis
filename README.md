 ##**Introduction**
 This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle Population dataset published by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset contains detailed records of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered across Washington State. It includes information such as vehicle make and model, model year, electric range, base MSRP, CAFV eligibility, and geographic details like county, city, and vehicle location. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of electric vehicle adoption, pricing trends, performance characteristics, and regional distribution.

The objectives of this analysis are to:

Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, zero values, and duplicate records.

Explore trends in electric vehicle adoption across model years, manufacturers, and counties.

Analyze the relationship between electric range and vehicle pricing (Base MSRP).

Visualize key insights using charts and graphs for better interpretation.

Build a linear regression model to predict the electric range of a vehicle based on selected features.

Derive insights that can support decision-making related to electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure planning.
